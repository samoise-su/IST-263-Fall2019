				<img src="https://samoise-su.github.io/IST-263-Fall2019/Rubys.png" alt="Ruby's">
				<p>Ruby's Diner is a chain with dozens of locations around the country. 
						However, none are as iconic as the location on the end of the Huntington Beach Pier. 
						After a day at the beach, patrons can enjoy a nice, sit-down meal, or order some fries and a 
						shake at the convinient window. This Ruby's is iconic and a must visit during a trip. </p></div>
			<div class="gallery"><h3>Cauldron Creamery, Costa Mesa</h3>
				<img src="https://samoise-su.github.io/IST-263-Fall2019/Cauldron.png" alt="Cauldron">
				<p>Cauldron is a local delicacy that was started in a garage in Orange County in 2014.
						The ice cream is made in front of you using dry ice, and served in a one of a kind Puffle Cone.
					   When looking for a cold treat to cool down after a long day, Cauldron is a great option.</p></div>
			<div class="gallery"><h3>Mi Casa, Orange</h3>
				<img src="https://samoise-su.github.io/IST-263-Fall2019/Tacos.jpg" alt="Tacos">
				<p>Mi Casa is best described as a hole in the wall taco shack in Orange. If you're looking for a fancy
						5 star restaurant, this isn't the place. But if you are looking for some of the best tacos in Southern California,
						look no further. </p></div>
