		<h4>Ruby's Diner, Huntington Beach</h4>

		<p>Ruby's Diner is a chain with dozens of locations around the country. 
			However, none are as iconic as the location on the end of the Huntington Beach Pier. 
			After a day at the beach, patrons can enjoy a nice, sit-down meal, or order some fries and a 
			shake at the convinient window. This Ruby's is iconic and a must visit during a trip. </p>
		<h4>Cauldron Creamery, Costa Mesa</h4>
		<img src="https://samoise-su.github.io/IST-263-Fall2019/Cauldron.png" alt="Cauldron">
		<p>Cauldron is a local delicacy that was started in a garage in Orange County in 2014.
			 The ice cream is made in front of you using dry ice, and served in a one of a kind Puffle Cone.
			When looking for a cold treat to cool down after a long day, Cauldron is a great option. </p>
		<h4>Mi Casa, Orange</h4>
		<img src="https://samoise-su.github.io/IST-263-Fall2019/Tacos.jpg" alt="Tacos">
		<p>Mi Casa is best described as a hole in the wall taco shack in Orange. If you're looking for a fancy
			5 star restaurant, this isn't the place. But if you are looking for some of the best tacos in Southern California,
			look no further.</p>
