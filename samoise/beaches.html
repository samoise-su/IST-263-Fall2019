			<p>Newport Beach is known for extravagant houses and yaughts just as big as the house they're attached to. For those of 
				us who don't live in these mansions, it is popular to rent a stand-up paddle board and paddle through the bay.
				Newport Beach also has its fair share of famous surf spots. The Wedge is known as one of the largest and most dangerous
				waves in the world, and attracts thrill seekers from all over.</p>
