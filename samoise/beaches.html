			<p>Laguna Beach is famous for picturesque views and mansions right off the cliffs. Tv shows such as the Hills have
				been filmed in Laguna and it is a favorite spot to relax for many celebrities. In Laguna Beach, you never know
				who you'll run into.

			<h4>Huntington Beach</h4>

			<p>Huntington Beach is also known as Surf City, USA. Home of the US Open of Surfing (which attracts millions of 
				viewers every August), Surf City is also a great spot to walk along the boardwalk or visit any of dozens of surf shops.

			<h4>Newport Beach</h4>

			<p>Newport Beach is known for extravagant houses and yaughts just as big as the house they're attached to. For those of 
				us who don't live in these mansions, it is popular to rent a stand-up paddle board and paddle through the bay.
				Newport Beach also has its fair share of famous surf spots. The Wedge is known as one of the largest and most dangerous
				waves in the world, and attracts thrill seekers from all over.</p>
